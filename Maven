What is POM?

POM stands for Project Object Model.
It is the fundamental unit of work in Maven.
Defined in an XML file named pom.xml, located in the root directory of every Maven project.
It describes the project structure, dependencies, plugins, build settings, and more.


What is Super POM?

Super POM is the default parent POM for all Maven projects.
It’s provided by Maven itself and contains default configurations that every project inherits if they are not overridden.
Located internally within Maven’s installation (you don’t edit this directly).
Helps reduce redundancy by setting default behaviors, such as:
Default source directory (src/main/java)
Default build plugins
Default repositories (e.g., Maven Central)
