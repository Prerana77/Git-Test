** Types of Inheritance **

1. Single Inheritance – One child class inherits from one parent.

2. Multilevel Inheritance – A class inherits from a class, which itself inherits from another.

3. Hierarchical Inheritance – Multiple child classes inherit from one parent.

4. Multiple Inheritance – A class inherits from more than one parent (not supported in Java classes directly, but supported via interfaces).

5. Hybrid Inheritance – A mix of the above (commonly found in C++).


** Key Features of Inheritance **

1. The child class inherits all non-private members of the parent class.

2. The child class can use, override, or extend the inherited methods.

3. Promotes code reusability – you don't have to rewrite code.
